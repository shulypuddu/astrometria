abstract = {Extreme climatic events (ECEs) are increasing in frequency, intensity, and/or duration due to climate change. These large deviations from average environmental conditions have strong impacts on ecosystems, exposing organisms to more severe conditions for longer periods of time than previously seen before. Many ECEs are well described by the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. The GEV has a long history as an accurate model across disciplines, including hydrology, finance, civil engineering, and climate science. Although the GEV is often used by climate scientists to characterize ECEs, such as hurricanes and floods, it is rarely included in ecological models. Furthermore, climate scientists typically model ECEs on large spatial scales (≫105 km2) whereas ecologically relevant spatial scales are often much smaller (e.g., <103 km2). Here, we demonstrate how to estimate a GEV for ECEs and “downscale” the model to an ecologically relevant spatial scale. We then show how to shift the GEV to account for climate change predictions and incorporate the GEV into ecological population models. The GEV is a flexible tool to model ECEs across event types and ecosystems. We discuss the implications and challenges of accurately modeling ECEs and quantitatively estimating their impacts on ecosystems.}
